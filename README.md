# Portfolio

### About me :wave:
Hello, my name is Gianfranco. Since early 2024, I have been studying and training to become a QA. I have knowledge in the areas of Full Stack Web Development and Data Analysis. I am happy to have finally found an area where I can complement myself and develop successfully. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of quality assurance and showcase the practical skills I have acquired through courses, self-study, and my work. I am determined to continue growing in this field. I have also started learning test automation, so at this point, my main goal is to expand my knowledge (and my practice!) in this area.

### My experience :office:
I have been developing as a full stack programmer for years, and in recent years I have also taken courses in data analysis and, in the last year, QA testing. During my time as a freelancer, I developed skills in teamwork, project management, programming, among others. My previous jobs, which had nothing to do with IT, provided me with social, team leadership, and management skills, which I believe are noteworthy. Currently, I would like to develop my skills in the area of QA as a Jr Tester.
